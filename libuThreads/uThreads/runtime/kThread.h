/**
 * @class kThread
 * @brief Object to represent kernel threads
 *
 * kThread is an interface for underlying kernel threads. kThreads
 * are pulling and pushing uThreads from ReadyQueue provided by the Cluster
 * and context switch to them and execute them. Each kThread belongs to
 * only and only one Cluster and it can only pull uThreads from the ReadyQueue
 * of that Cluster. However, kThreads can push uThreads to the ReadyQueue
 * of any cluster.
 *
 * defaultKT is the first kernel thread that executes and is responsible for
 * running the main() function. defaultKT is created when the program starts.
 *
 * Each kThread has a mainUT which is a uThread used when the ReadyQueue
 * is empty. mainUT is used to switch out the previous uThread and either
 * pull uThreads from the ReadyQueue if it's not empty, or block on a
 * condition variable waiting for uThreads to be pushed to the queue.
 *
 * kThreads can be created by passing a Cluster to the constructor of
 * the kThread.
