/**
 * @class Cluster
 * @brief Scheduler and Cluster of kThreads.
 *
 * Cluster is an entity that contains multiple kernel threads (kThread).
 * Each cluster is responsible for maintaining a ready queue
 * and performing basic scheduling tasks. Programs can have as many Clusters
 * as is necessary.
 * The Cluster's ReadyQueue is a multiple-producer multiple-consumer queue where
 * consumers are only kThreads belonging to that Cluster, and producers can be any
 * running kThread. kThreads constantly push and pull uThreads to/from the ReadyQueue.
 * Cluster is an interface between kThreads and the ReadyQueue,
 * and also provides the means to group kThreads together.
 *
 * Each Cluster has its own IOHandler. IOHandler is responsible for
 * providing asynchronous nonblocking access to IO devices. For now each
 * instance of an IOHandler has its own dedicated poller thread, which
 * means each cluster has a dedicated IO poller thread when it is created.
 * This might change in the future.
 * Each uThread that requires access to IO uses the IOHandler to avoid blocking
 * the kThread, if the device is ready for read or write, the uThread continues
 * otherwise it blocks until it is ready, and the kThread execute another uThread
 * from the ReadyQueue.
 *
 * When the program starts a defaultCluster is created for the kernel thread that
 * runs the _main_ function. defaultCluster can be used like any other clusters.
